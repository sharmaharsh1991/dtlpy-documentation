# PDF to JPG Function with Trigger
This is an example for a function with a trigger.  
Function will reciev a PDF item as input and convert it to JPG image.  

We will also create a trigger on a directory.  
The input directory will be "/incoming", and the output "/output" which means that we'll upload a PDF to incoming, and we will receive a JPG in output

After running the 'create_package.py' (which will create package, service and trigger) upload a PDF to the project

* Note: be sure to change the project name to your own working project
