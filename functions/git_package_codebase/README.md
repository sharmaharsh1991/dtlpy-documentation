# deploy package with code from git

this support in dtlpy>=1.35.13

1. create a public package in github  
   Simple example for it is [git repo](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/package_git_example)  
   main.py - for the running code


2. create a package and service from the git repository  
   use the file [create package](create_package.py)
   that build the package and service using push and deploy functions to set your own git repo set it in the
   package.push() in codebase filed  
   git_url: the url that use to clone  
   git_tag: tag is the branch

test it by make an execution for this service  
**make sure to set the item_id in filed value**  

    execution = service.execute(execution_input=dl.FunctionIO(name='item',
                                                              value=<item_id>,
                                                              type=dl.PackageInputType.ITEM),
                                project_id=project.id, 
                                function_name='run')

And can see the execution flow and status in our UI Go to Applications prease in the service and choose lastExecution

   `service.update()`
